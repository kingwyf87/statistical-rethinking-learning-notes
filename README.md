# Statistical Rethinking Learning Notes

In this repository, I follow the book [STATISTICAL RETHINKING](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath and implement the code using Python following [Statistical Rethinking with Python and PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking).
